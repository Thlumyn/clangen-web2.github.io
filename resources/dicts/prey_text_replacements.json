    "add new prey species to the relevant biome lists:",
    "prey species should be added to both the singular and the plural lists e.g mouse, mice",
    "prey species need to be completely non-seasonal, e.g no eggs, no chicks",
    "prey species need to have names that make sense for cats",
    "e.g yellow mouse (great), New York rat (no)",

    "wet biomes have been removed from the web version",
    "some animals e.g crabs are appropriate for both dry land and aquatic lists",
    "these lists allow writers to describe a fishing patrol and not fish up a squirrel",

    "be sure to put your snippet in the relevant 'size' category",
    "do not count tail lengths in these size categories - this is about how much edible meat the cat has hunted",
    "tiny prey species are an inch to a 3 inches big, could be held in a cat's mouth, e.g a mouse",
    "medium prey species are 3 inches to 6 inches long, easily carried by a cat e.g a blackbird",
    "big prey species are 6-12 inches long, heavy enough to be hard to carry by a cat e.g a rabbit",
    "prey species bigger than this are too large for the randomised prey lists",
    "instead, make them the focus of their own patrol"
